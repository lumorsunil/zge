# zge (zig-game-engine name is a WIP)

This is my game engine that I'm using for my games written in Zig.

I'm making this available for educational purposes, it is not meant to be a game engine that anyone can pick up and use.

It uses [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) and [zig-ecs](https://github.com/prime31/zig-ecs).

For vector math it uses my own "library" (in repo) which uses Zig vectors and some helper functions.

There's also a physics engine, which uses Zig's builtin vectorization to store and calculate body positions, velocities etc.

It is very much a WIP.
